<h1>Designed a Template</h1>

<p> In this project I have designed a web template using HTML, CSS.
This tenplate has a few animation effects like hover, radio buttons.<br> 
I have also added a contact form for messages andfontawesome icons.
This is a static web template created just to show HTML and CSS skills.
No links directed to different pages.</p>
